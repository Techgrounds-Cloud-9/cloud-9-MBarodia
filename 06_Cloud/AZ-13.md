### Azure Files

Azure File is an Azure File storage service used to screate shared file in the cloud.
It uses SMB and NFS protocols which enables you to access files remotely or on-premises via API through encrypted communications. Each file share is limited to 5TB but you can operate multiple shares.

#### Pros of using Azure Files:

Fully managed service: Managemnt and Maintenance tasks are handled automatically by this cloud service.

Shared Access: Based on SMB, so mostly compatible with most onpremise application and services.

Redundancy: The data stored in Azure Files is 99.999999999% durable.

Easy Automation: Azure Files is compatible with most common automation tools and can be managed through a variety of interfaces, including PowerShell, Azure CLI, Azure Storage Explorer, and Azure Portal.

Easy APIs: Includes a built in REST APIs and client libarries for simplified interfacing.

#### Limitations of Azure Files:

Backup: Azure Fikes doesnot have built in mechansim of snapshots or automatic backups . So the backups need to be performed regularly.

Performance: Throughput is limited to 60MB/s on the standard tier. The premium tier offers higher limits but may cost significantly more.

Size Limitations: You can only store 5TB per STANDARD storage account and upto 100TB spread across 20 accounts. The premium tier can scale upto 100TB per account, but that involves significant costs.

File System Limitation: The limit for individual file is 1TB. You can store up to 200k system objects per account and file names can be up to 255 characters. These limitations primarily present issues for legacy migrations.

### Azure Database (+ managed instance) 

#### Azure SQL Managed Instance

Features:
 * Intelligent and Scalable Cloud Database Service
 * Closely 100% compatible with latest SQL Server DB Engine
 * Combines the broadest SQL server databse engine with all benefits of fully managed platform as a Service.
 * It allows the existing SQL Server customers to lift and Shift their on premise application to cloud with minimum application and db changes.
 * Security Features:

        * Data encyption in motion
        * SQL Managed Instance auditing tracks database events and writes them to an audit log file placed in the Azure Storage account.
        * Dynamic Data Masking - Masks the data to non-priviledged users.
        * Controls access to rows in database tables.
        * Encypts SQL MI data files. Encryption uses a database encyption key(DEK) which is stored in database boot record.
        * Authentication - 3 Types of authentication is possible, SQL Authentication using USername and password, Azure Active directory authentication and windows authentication for Azure active directory principals.
        * Authorization - SQL MI has the same authorization capabilities as SQL Server 2017.

#### Azure SQL Database

Its an fully managed PaaS database engine that handles most of the database management functions such as upgrading, patching backups and monitoring without user involvement.
