# [AZURE ACTIVE DIRECTORY, MONITOR, COSMOS DB]
# AZURE 14

## Key terminology
●	Containers - AKS and Azure Container instance
●	Azure Support Plans - Microsoft offers various support plans to its users/customers.
●	Azure Advisor - Azure advisor is a FREE service that was created to continuously scan the services for all the improvments according to Microsoft best practices. It is designed to provide recommendations and best practices for Cost, Security, Relaiability and Performance.
●	Azure App Configuration - This is a service that centrally manages application settings. This is used to store all the setiings for your application and secure their access in one place.
●	Azure Activity Log - The activity logs shows the details of the events. For example, we craete a VM, stop it, again restart it or whenever we make modifications to the resources. All this information is captured in the activity log with the time stamp, user details and the activity performed.
Activity logs are different than audit logs, which record customer interactions with data or the settings of the service.

Example:
![Activity Log]()
![Activity Log after changes]()

## Exercise

●	Azure Active Directory
   An Azure Active directory is a cloud based Identity provider and an Access Management Service. Unlike the classical way of storing the user credentials in the database for every application differently, this method lets the client interact directly with the "Identity Provider", Azure Active Directory to get a token and send the same token to different application servers to login. The server in turn sends the token to the Identity Provider to verify the user credentials to allow them to login.

●	Azure Monitor - In Azure Monitoring can be done in 7 different ways for different use cases. 

    1. Application insight - To monitor a single application, that could be a Web application or a desktop application.
    2. Visual Studio App Center - This is also used for monitoring single application.
    3. Azure Network Watcher - This is there to watch your network like to troubleshoot network issues, ip addresses, to find out the next hop and also to troubleshoot Virtal machine access issues.
    4. **Azure Monitor** - Azure  monitor is really meant as an overall monitoring system in Azure. You use that to monitor multiple applications or for an instance. All your applications within the subscription or within the resource group.
    5. Security Center - It monitors all your services actively and also tells you which services are less secure than others. Also, suggests the next action to imptove security of those services.
    6. Azure Advisor - It monitors all your services and comes up with recommendations not only for security but also for performance, availability and for costs.

    It Collects data from all of your Azure services. In Azure there are lots of things that generate data and log files and metrics. Also, Azure servuce that run your application and your database application themselves like the dot net application also has internal logs. The virtal machine agents can derive data from VM and Also data from data collector APIs.
   All of the data goes into a log, **Log analytics workspace**. And, the other data store for Azure Monitor is called **Azure monitor metrics** and this collectes time series based metrics, things like memory usage and CPU usage.
   And within Azure monitor you can analyse both of these data sources.

   Its also possible to **create a alert rule in the Azure Monitoring Service.**

●	Azure Functions 

Azure functions is a serverless compute service that executes the code without you managing the server and infrastructure. It is used to deploy and run small piece of code. It supports multiple language viz, Dot net, Python, Java, Node.js, PowerShell Core, Typescript, F#, Custom Handler


●	Event Grid, Queue Storage, Service Bus
