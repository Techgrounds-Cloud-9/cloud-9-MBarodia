## Key terminology

1. Azure Data Center - An Azure data center is a unique physical building that contains thousands of physical servers with it's own power, cooling and networking infrastructure. These data ceneters are located all over the globe. As of November 2020, there are over 160+ Azure datacenters worldwide. It is these dataceneters that are the building blocks of gloabl Azure infrastructure.

2. Azure Resources - Resources are instances of azure services that you create, like virtual machines, app services, storage accounts, SQL databases, function apps etc. All these are azure services. Everytime you create an instance of a service, you are creating a resource. There are hundereds of azure services.

3. Kubernetes Cluster - A Kubernetes cluster is a set of nodes that run containerized applications. Containerizing applications packages an app with its dependences and some necessary services. They are more lightweight and flexible than virtual machines.

## Exercise

1. Regions and Region Pairs

Region: Azure region is a group of one or more data centers.  A Region could be made up of just 1 dataceneter or multiple datacenters. 

![Region]()

Region Pairs: Azure paired regions means pair of regions in the same geography. The two Azure regions are related within the same geographic area and provide geographically redundant solutions. The terms, Regional Pair, Paired region and Region pair are used interchangeably.

![region Pair]()

2. Availability Zones: 

As the name suggests, the availability zones are the data centers with their own power, cooling and network. There could be a physical or logical seperation among data centers. Thry ensure high availability of applications.

3. Resource Groups:

Azure Resource Groups are logical collections of virtual machines, storage accounts, virtual networks, web apps, databases, and/or database servers. Its a logical container where you create your own resources.

![Resource Group](ResourceGrp)

4. Subscriptions:

An Azure subscription is tied to a single account, the one that was used to create it and is also used for billing. Resources can be supplied as instances of the many Azure products and services under the subscription. Free, pay-as-you-go, and member offers are the three primary types of subscriptions accessible.

5. Management Groups:

Azure Management group is a kind of IAM(Identity and Access Management) for all  users. It defines all the role based access controls and role definition.

![Management Groups](MgmtGroup)

6. Azure Resource Manager

Its one of the Azure Service used to manage deploy and monitor Azure resources.

7. Virtual Machines

Azure VM is a logical system or computing service that allows user to host their application or system. Its an on-demand scalable computing rsource which has usage based pricing.

8. Azure App Services

Azure app service is a type of fully managed hosting service using which developers can develop mobile or web applications. It is fully managed PaaS (Platform as a Service), that integrates Microsoft Azure Websites, Mobile Services, and BizTalk Services into a single service.

9. Azure Container Instances (ACI)

Azure Container Instances (ACI) is a managed service that allows you to run containers directly on the Microsoft Azure public cloud, without requiring the use of virtual machines (VMs).

10. Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) is Azure's managed service for Kubernetes. It reduces the complexity of building and managing Kubernetes clusters.


11. Azure Virtual Desktop

Azure Virtual Desktop is a desktop-as-a-service (DaaS) offering that allows customers to run virtual app and desktop services from the Azure Public Cloud.
It is a cloud-based virtual desktop and application platform that runs in Azure and has exclusive features like Windows 10 enterprise multi-session.
On June 7, 2021, Microsoft announced the change of the Windows Virtual Desktop product name to Azure Virtual Desktop.
