# Azure-04

## Key terminology

1. Azure Data Center - An Azure data center is a unique physical building that contains thousands of physical servers with it's own power, cooling and networking infrastructure. These data ceneters are located all over the globe. As of November 2020, there are over 160+ Azure datacenters worldwide. It is these dataceneters that are the building blocks of gloabl Azure infrastructure.

2. Azure Resources - Resources are instances of azure services that you create, like virtual machines, app services, storage accounts, SQL databases, function apps etc. All these are azure services. Everytime you create an instance of a service, you are creating a resource. There are hundereds of azure services.

3. Kubernetes Cluster - A Kubernetes cluster is a set of nodes that run containerized applications. Containerizing applications packages an app with its dependences and some necessary services. They are more lightweight and flexible than virtual machines.

## Exercise

1. Regions and Region Pairs

Region: Azure region is a group of one or more data centers.  A Region could be made up of just 1 dataceneter or multiple datacenters.

Region Pairs: Azure paired regions means pair of regions in the same geography. The two Azure regions are related within the same geographic area and provide geographically redundant solutions. The terms, Regional Pair, Paired region and Region pair are used interchangeably.

2. Availability Zones: 

As the name suggests, the availability zones are the data centers with their own power, cooling and network. There could be a physical or logical seperation among data centers. Thry ensure high availability of applications.

3. Resource Groups:

Azure Resource Groups are logical collections of virtual machines, storage accounts, virtual networks, web apps, databases, and/or database servers. Its a logical container where you create your own resources.

4. Subscriptions:

An Azure subscription is tied to a single account, the one that was used to create it and is also used for billing. Resources can be supplied as instances of the many Azure products and services under the subscription. Free, pay-as-you-go, and member offers are the three primary types of subscriptions accessible.

5. Management Groups:

Azure Management group is a kind of IAM(Identity and Access Management) for all  users. It defines all the role based access controls and role definition.

6. Azure Resource Manager

Its one of the Azure Service used to manage deploy and monitor Azure resources.

7. Virtual Machines

Azure VM is a logical system or computing service that allows user to host their application or system. Its an on-demand scalable computing rsource which has usage based pricing.

8. Azure App Services

Azure app service is a type of fully managed hosting service using which developers can develop mobile or web applications. It is fully managed PaaS (Platform as a Service), that integrates Microsoft Azure Websites, Mobile Services, and BizTalk Services into a single service.

9. Azure Container Instances (ACI)

Azure Container Instances (ACI) is a managed service that allows you to run containers directly on the Microsoft Azure public cloud, without requiring the use of virtual machines (VMs).

10. Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) is Azure's managed service for Kubernetes. It reduces the complexity of building and managing Kubernetes clusters.


11. Azure Virtual Desktop

Azure Virtual Desktop is a desktop-as-a-service (DaaS) offering that allows customers to run virtual app and desktop services from the Azure Public Cloud.
It is a cloud-based virtual desktop and application platform that runs in Azure and has exclusive features like Windows 10 enterprise multi-session.
On June 7, 2021, Microsoft announced the change of the Windows Virtual Desktop product name to Azure Virtual Desktop.

12. Virtual Networks

A virtual network is a private network in Azure. It is a logical presentation of the network on cloud.


13. VPN Gateway

VPN Gateway allows you to connect the client machines to the cloud network.

14. Virtual Network Peering

Its a concept of connecting the virtual networks. Once peered, the virtual networks appear as one for connectivity purposes.


15. ExpressRoute

Azure Express route allows a private connection between an on-premises data center local network and the Microsoft cloud.

16. Container (Blob) Storage

Azure Blob storage is Microsoft's object storage solution for the cloud. Blob storage is optimized for storing massive amounts of unstructured data, such as text or binary data.

17. Disk Storage

It is a service that allows you to create disks for your virtual machines. A disk created in Disk Storage can be accessed from only one virtual machine. In other words - it is your local drive.
It is is the only shared cloud block storage which supports Window and Linux both.

18. File Storage

Its a service provided to provided to support the Azure VM. File storage is a network share. You can store files there that can be accessed from different Virtual Machines.


19. Storage Tiers
Three storage tiers are available in Azure, Hot Access, Cool Access and Archive tier. 
All 3 are used based on the use cases.
Hot tier is used for data which is frequently accessed by applications. The storage costs are higher but the access charges are low for this tier.
Cool Tier is used for data that is rarely accessed is expected to be stored for 30 days.
Archive tier, For this tier the storage rate is the cheapest on Azure, but the data retrieval charges are very high.The Data can be stored for upto 180 days.


20. Cosmos DB
Azure Cosmos DB is used for web, mobile, gaming, and IoT application that needs to handle massive amounts of data, reads, and writes at a global scale. It is also used for the applications that handles big amount of data, like reading and writing data frequently at global scale.

21. Azure SQL Database
Azure SQL is based on SQL Server engine. 

22. Azure Database for MySQL
Most Commonly used database among customers.

23. Azure Database for PostgreSQLused in Azure.
A relational database service based on the open-source Postgres database engine.

24. SQL Managed Instance
Azure SQL Managed Instance is a fully-managed deployment option designed to provide near-perfect compatibility for SQL migrations.


25. Azure Marketplace

Azure Marketplace is a powerful channel to market and sell your cloud solutions certified to run on Azure.
