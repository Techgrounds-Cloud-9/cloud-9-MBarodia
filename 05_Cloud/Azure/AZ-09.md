### All about Shared Responsibility Model


The traditional On-Premise Model - On-premise model states that to maintain any server, we must own, the infrastructure, the platform and the softwares by ourself. 
For example, a startup company following the on premise model, has to make The capital expenditure for acquiring physical servers, networking gadgets, have to hire network engineers for maintenance of those servers.
All the installations, upgrades, patch application and fixation has to be managed by the company.
Whereas, by Using IaaS, Paas and SaaS, the responsibility of owning and maintaning the infrastructure, platform and software can be shared.
Setting up your own infrastructure requires- 
1. Data & Access
2. Applications
3. Runtime
4. Operating systems
5. Virtual machine 
6. compute
7. Networking
8. Storage

When the Storage, networking and compute are managed by the cloud provider, then the service model is **IaaS**.

When the Storage, networking, compute, virtual machine, Operating system and runtime are managed by the cloud provider, then the service model is **PaaS**.

And, when the Applications, Storage, networking, compute, virtual machine, Operating system and runtime are managed by the cloud provider, then the service model is SaaS service model. In case of **SaaS**, <u>only the Data &Access (Information, Data, Devices, Accounts and Identities)are managed by you</u> and rest all other services are managed by the cloud provider. These are hosted and managed by the cloud provider or the customer. 
SaaS requires the least amount of management by Cloud Customer.
It is usually licensed through monthly or annual subscriptipon.
Examples, Microsoft 365, Microsoft Teams, Dynamics 365 and Skype 

**In all Cloud Deployment service models, IaaS, PaaS and SaaS, the Cloud Customer always owns the Data, the Accounts and the identities AND the customer itself is responsible for maintaiing the security of your data, accounts, identities & on premise resources**

Shared Responsibility model implies the set of resposibilities which will be handled by the cloud provider and which all services will be handled by you. The workload responsibilities vary depending on which service model you choose. 
This model helps in sharing the responsibilties in a very transparent and clear manner.
