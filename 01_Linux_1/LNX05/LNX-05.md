# [File permissions]
# LINUX 5

## Key terminology

/pwd - This directory in root contains the list of all users in that machine.
sudo - Sudo is a super user with all rights and privileges.

## Exercise
* Create a text file.
* Make a long listing to view the file’s permissions. Who is the file’s owner and group? What kind of permissions does the file have?
* Make the file executable by adding the execute permission (x).
* Remove the read and write permissions (rw) from the file for the group and everyone else, but not for the owner. Can you still read it?
* Change the owner of the file to a different user. If everything went well, you shouldn’t be able to read the file unless you assume root privileges with ‘sudo’.
* Change the group ownership of the file to a different group.
