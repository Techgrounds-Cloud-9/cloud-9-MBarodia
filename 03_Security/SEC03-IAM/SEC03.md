## Results
1. Authentication as the word suggests checks the user identity before allowing the access to the system and authorization means the set of right and access user has once the user is inside the system.

2. MFA is multi factor authentication before the user is allowed to enter and access the system. Its a method where users have to authenticate their access in more than one way.
A common everyday example can be after entering the username and password, the user is also asked to enter the OTP(one time password) which is sent to email or over the phone. 
Other ways to apply MFA component are prompting for the user thumb print, sending a unique code through Secureid, Captcha Key, e-identifier, retina detection or voice recognition etc.

**MFA is important to enhance the organizational scurity. The multi level authorization keeps invalid users away from the crucial networks, critical databases and applications of the organization. This is acheived through next level authorization check, lile OTPs, thumb prints or secureids badge, where first level authorization being the username and the password.**

Three Factors of MFA - 
* Something you know - Knowledge - OTP or PIN
* Something you possess - Possession - Phone, Badge or key
* Something you are - Inherence - Retina, finger prints or voice recognition

MFA works on the mechanism that the user will be granted access only after giving atleast 2 levels of evidence to access a system, an app or a website etc.

3. Principle of least privilege - Also commonly adderessed as POLP, the priciple of least privilege means the user are assigned only the rights which are essential to do their current jobs. 


**MFA is authentication mechanism and POLP is an authorization mechanism.**
