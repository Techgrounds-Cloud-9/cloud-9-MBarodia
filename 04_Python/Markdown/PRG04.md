## Key terminology

### Exercise 1:

Exercise 1:
Create a new script.
Create a variable x and give it the value 0.
Use a while loop to print the value of x in every iteration of the loop. After printing, the value of x should increase by 1. The loop should run as long as x is smaller than or equal to 10.
Example output:

Python Code
<pre><code>
x = 0
y=int(input("x: "))
print(y)
while y <=10:
    print(y)
    print("completed one cycle")
    break

Output
![Exercise 1]()
</pre>
</code>

### Exercise 2:

Create a new script.
Copy the code below into your script.
 for i in range(10):
    # do something here
Print the value of i in the for loop. You did not manually assign a value to i. Figure out how its value is determined.
Add a variable x with value 5 at the top of your script.
Using the for loop, print the value of x multiplied by the value of i, for up to 50 iterations.

Python Code:
<pre><code>
x=5
y=0
i=0
for i in range(10):
    print(i)
    print(x)
    print(x*i)
    
</pre>
</code>
### Exercise 3:
Create a new script.
Copy the array below into your script.
arr = ["Coen", "Casper", "Joshua", "Abdessamad", "Saskia"]
Use a for loop to loop over the array. Print every name individually.

<pre><code>

Python Code:

arr = ["Coen", "Casper", "Joshua", "Abdessamad", "Saskia"]
for x in arr:
    print(x)
    continue
  
</pre>
</code>
