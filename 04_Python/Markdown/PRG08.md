# PRG08

## Key terminology
* Dictionaries in Python - It is an composite data type in python.  Dictionaries are different from Python lists in the context of how you access both of them. List elements are accessed by their position in the list, via indexing and Dictionary elements are accessed via keys.
* csv File Handling - Python has a predefined package for csv file handling, to read, write and append the data to file. Use "import csv" on top of the script to use the package.


## Exercise

### Exercise 1: 
<pre><code>
Create a dictionary with the following keys and values:
Key             Value
First name      Casper
Last name       Velzen
Job title       Lead Learning Coach
Company         TechGrounds
</pre>
</code>

Loop over the dictionary and print every key-value pair in the terminal.

### Exercise 2:

Create a new script.
Use user input to ask for their information (first name, last name, job title, company). Store the information in a dictionary.
Write the information to a csv file (comma-separated values). The data should not be overwritten when you run the script multiple times.
