## What went well?
Azure
- Communication amng the team was the strength this week.
AWS
- The assigments combination of the practical and theoratical were interesting.
- Interactive exercises were pretty interesting to do.


## What could have gone better?
Azure
 - Spent more time reading then implementing. Extended  hours of reading was required.
 - Availability of Instance was delayed 
 - There was lots of documentation related to Azure assignments
 - Some questions in KC appeared untouched due to incomplete coverage.
 AWS
 - More time for studying needed. 
- Since we have to document even thoeretical part there is not much time left to study more for new topics.

## What can we do to improve?
AWS and Azure
- We could use a more efficient way of studying of new topics. TRy sample tests, mayve use Reskill more.
- When doing a theoratical exercise also look into the knowledge from the Exam Guide, to get a complete image.
- Making notes would help
- We can be more structured while reading the concepts.
